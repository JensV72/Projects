# Portfolio Projects – Jens Verhoeff

This repository provides a visual and practical overview of the meaningful projects I have worked on — and continue to develop — since the beginning of my studies in Creative Media and Game Technology. It reflects both my technical growth and my passion for building thoughtful, user-centered digital experiences.

## Project 1: Handen Vol Trots/Viseble Voices

**Description:**  
An innovative art installation that empowers deaf children to create visual art using sign language. Through the use of AI and TouchDesigner, the system translates hand gestures into interactive visuals, enabling a playful, accessible, and inclusive artistic experience.

**Problem Statement:**  
Sign language is often viewed as "different" or something that should adapt to the hearing world. This perception can affect how children experience their language and identity. By transforming sign language into visual art, this installation highlights the beauty and power of this form of communication — helping children feel proud of their unique way of expressing themselves.

**Design Question:**  
How can we create an interactive art installation that allows deaf children to express themselves freely and proudly through sign language?

**Technology:**  
TouchDesigner · SketchUp · Python · Google’s AI Sign Language Detection

**Demo / Visuals:**

## Project 2: Roltie

**Description:**  
A mobile application designed to help people with motor disabilities navigate public transportation more reliably. The app includes a route planner that factors in real-time elevator and escalator outages at stations such as Beurs. When planning a route, it clearly indicates which elevators or escalators are currently out of service. The data is crowdsourced — users can report outages themselves, similar to how Flitsmeister collects real-time traffic updates — making the system more responsive and community-driven.

**Problem Statement:**  
For most travelers, encountering broken escalators and elevators is a minor inconvenience. But for those who rely on them, it can mean facing unexpected obstacles with no immediate support or alternative route available.

**Design Question:**  
How can we ensure that students with motor disabilities are informed about broken elevators and escalators, and receive the best possible route based on that information?
